\item
  It has unique NFT collections for users to explore, each NFT is built in with special features and functionalities. Players can choose their favorite cartoon figures and enhance the characters through competition. The NFTs are also tradeable both in game or through third-party platforms such as Opensea and rarible etc.
\item
  It creates a safe entertainment environment. RNG(Random Number Generation) mechanism by utilizing blockchain verification is proven that will make the card shuffling based on pure randomness that avoid possible hacking of many forms.
\item
  It aims to build a pure crypto poker community . Simple and hustle-free process of deposit and withdraw. Degen will not accommodate flat currency deposit, only crypto currencies with be accepted. So that means the platform will not ask for your credit card information, billing address, etc. In fact, they will not even ask for your name. It will support depositing BTC, ETH and stable coins (USDT, USDC, DAI) from all supported chains (ETH, BSC, Polygon, TRX, SOL)
